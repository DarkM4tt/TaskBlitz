Steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Open your terminal and run the following command:
  git clone https://github.com/DarkM4tt/TaskBlitz.git

2. Open the Application: Navigate to the cloned directory (TaskBlitz) and double-click index.html in your web browser.
  Make sure you have index.html, style.css, and script.js in the same folder.

Optional Build Steps (For Larger Projects):

For complex applications, consider using a task runner like Gulp or Grunt to automate tasks like:

Combining CSS files
Minifying JavaScript code

These steps improve performance and organization but aren't necessary for this project.
